I have an intense desire to contribute to the development of the digital infrastracture of Web3 in any capacity. Having followed the evolving narratives around the applications of blockchain for the last several years, i'm convinced that its value-alignment mechanism will have an undeniable impact on the the way people transact and societies operate. Though this may be a platitude of sorts at this point in time, i'm still extremenly motivated by the promise of mechanism design and would like to participate in this process firsthand.

My primary background is computational biology and engineering and my long-term goal is to try to make a ubiquitous impact in healthcare and medicine. My current intuition is that an important and non-obvious obstacle to the development of transformative technologies in healthcare are not technical hurdles, of which there are plenty, but the way humans interact with their biological data. Put shortly, i think a change in attitude and the mental model of individual health is what will be the real watershed moment for biotechnologies. Such a societal shift is uniquely enabled by blockchain technologies in the sphere of individual finance and beyond, we are told. I'm intensely curious if this can be transposed to health at any point.

My medium-term goals are to learn in earnest about the primitives and concepts of the new "stack", most of which i find mathmatically stimulating and useful on their own. I'm likewise very poorly acquainted with the "cryptonomics" or conventional finance for that matter and would appreciate experiences to fill that gap as well. I have no lack of excitement for philosphical implications of cryptography, as one can probably tell from this, but have as much appreciation for computational problems that have nothing to do with it.
