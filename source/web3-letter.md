I'd love to contribute to the development of the digital infrastracture of Web3 in any capacity. Having followed the narratives of blockchain applications for the last several years, I am convinced that the value-alignment mechanism will have an impact on the way people transact and societies operate. I'm extremenly motivated by the promise of mechanism design and would like to participate in this process firsthand.

My medium-term goals are to learn in earnest about the primitives and concepts of the new "stack", most of which i find mathematically stimulating and useful on their own.
I would in equal measure appreciate opportunities to learn more about cryptonomics. Put shortly, I have no lack of excitement for philosphical implications of cryptography but have as much appreciation for computational and infrastractural problems in their own turn.

A "self-starter" attitude, versatility and resilience are three positive things that describe me. Lucid communication, capacity for complex coordination and good humor are things that i strive for in social contexts and would work hard to provide for colleagues. I'm also fairly resilient to operational uncertainty and try to be as independent as my competences allow me to when delivering on a vision.
