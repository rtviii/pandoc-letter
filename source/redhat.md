Hi. My name is Artem, i'm 23. I'd love to work with and learn from engineers at RedHat.

Coming from a background in computational biology, I'm incredibly passionate about systems of scale and am at my most engaged when trying to apprehend and bring structure to them. This is especially true for the state of modern software stack and the complexity creep that characterizes it

My long-term goal and dream is to be able to contribute in a significant way to the digital infrastracture associated with healthcare. In the short to medium term -- i see no better way to acquaint myself with the field and its frontier than apprenticing myself to engineers of highest quality, Redhat. Given the confluence of technologies and softwares in RedHat's operation i find the opportunity to belong and contribute -- even in a small way -- incredibily enriching. 

I am confident that my commitment to generalism and technical competencies will make me a valuable candidate for this position.


Thanks in advance
Positively,
Artie
