Hi. My name is Artem, i'm 23. I'd love to work with and learn from engineers at Confluent in any capacity. 

Coming from a background of computational biology, I'm incredibly passionate about systems of scale and thrive on bringing organization to them. I feel the same about the state of modern software stack and the complexity creep that characterizes it. 
 Having picked up on the iconic Log article by Jay Kreps a few years ago and having learnt a little bit about the product that those ideas grew into, i instantly wanted to work with or close to tools like these. I like to think that this goes beyond the blind desire to automate routines away and find structure and simplicity in a solution like this one. 

I also feel like i'm not alone in this and it's why Kafka thrives in this cambrian explosion of cloud services and meshy stacks. I would value an opportunity to be exposed to the workings and culture of Confluent for this reason and am confident that i have enough experience and breadth of perspective to contribute. 

Thanks in advance
Positively,
Artie
